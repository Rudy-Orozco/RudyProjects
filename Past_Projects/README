        > Unix Shell
            Demonstrates a simple Unix shell created with C and allows basic functionality
            such as ls, cd, and other system clals
        > Malloc
            Uses different memory allocation methods to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses
            of each algorithm. Uses First, Next, Best, and Worst Fit algorithms.
        > Xv6 Encryption
            Created a system call within the Xv6 Operating System to be able to encrypt a
            file using XOR operations on each byte. Directly edits each file on the disk.
