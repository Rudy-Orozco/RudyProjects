My implementation for making an eval function for the depth limit is as follows:

val = abs(#_blue_marbles - #_red_marbles)

Reason I think this implementaion works is that this ensures that the amount of marbles per each turn stays balance
as at a certain point near the end of the game, the computer performs certain moves at a specific time. For example
when the marbles either marbles reach 3, the computer will always choose the other pile until both marble piles are 3,
to then it decides the next best optimal move consistantly. This way, when using dpeth limited search, it will always
balance out the total marbles to each other.
